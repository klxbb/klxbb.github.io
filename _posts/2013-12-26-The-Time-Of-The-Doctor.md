title: The Time Of The Doctor a.k.a. Open Letter to Steven Moffat
---
Dear Steven,

In light—or in my case slightly light but ultimately darkly lit bedroom—of the recent airing of The Time Of The Doctor, I thought it suitable to deliver my thoughts to you in the most obtuse yet equally useless manner; a web log post.

Although it might first be worth explaining that I've been watching The Doctor and his merry band of misfits (and lovers and concubines) since the first times of my short—and arguably long—life that I can actually remember. Unlike The Doctor who goes from remembering a blonde girl he fell in love with a hundred years ago to forgetting about everything to suddenly remembering something like 100 years of sitting on a planet doing bugger all. Every single day of it, in fact.

You see, I get that somehow in that wibbly wobbly head of yours there's a smidgeon of hope that even the brightest of humans will love and accept you for the inner fan-fiction-writing-fan-girl that you are. I get that in the deepest darkest midst of your perpetual longing for cleverness you admire yourself in the cool dark light of your own brilliance. I even get that you wouldn't ever dare speak anything remotely positive about the people who dislike your writing—or pretentiousness—probably because you think that they're wrong or 'just don't get it'.

What I don't get is how you can perpetuate this nonsensical disaster that is your lack of self-control when it comes to creating sensible and understandable plots that even the slightly intellectual can follow with some sense of continuity. For all we could've known—for all you would've loved—the Doctor was going to regenerate into a woman. Never mind the rules being broken about the number of regenerations being suddenly broken for an entire generation—the generation which, I would remind you, you are writing for—of fans.

We might have even been just distracted enough to not notice that The Doctor's secret name is, wait for it, The Doctor. Or that it's been dangled in front of our—and arguably many other characters on the show of which I now am unable to count due to their existential insignificance—faces. What's the point in something so centrally trivial that it must be uttered in just about every season finale or episode just for dramatic—or perhaps now ironic—effect.

I know that somewhere—deep and unfortunately extremely far down—inside of you there is a human being. One with irrational emotions who can't help but be wound up in the previous life of Amelia Pond and the heartbreaking yet beautiful marriage between The Girl Who Waited and The Last Centurion.

Unluckily enough that human being was murdered when even the concept of retroactive continuity was introduced to the show and we witnessed the birth of a character so polarising even The Weeping Angels dare not speak her name. That was a joke (the part about the angels was a joke. The rest, well, no it wasn't). Of course you were too busy fussing over how we can of course integrate (The Marvellous- no, The Stupendous- no, River- wait, I know, let's call her) The River Song into yet another episode where she does not belong, let alone even deserve a reference.

Yet in that hideously green light of a TARDIS in human forme with the libido of a hormone-crazed puppy seemingly unable to grasp the English—or is it Timelord—language after many hundreds of years, we witnessed one of the most fantastical cameo appearances in the history of televised media. The diamond in the rough, as they say. A very rough few seasons indeed.

The appearance of the sensually brilliant pre-marriage Amelia Pond was a welcome addition to an episode in which all my hopes of emotional send-offs had been suspended in disbelief of the fact that a Timelord so wound up in things being humany-wumany would suddenly forget, I don't know, perhaps some of the most important 'humany-wumany humans' there are.

Don't misunderstand me, I had my ups and downs with The Girl Who Waited. I both loved her and hated her (though I don't represent the human race on River Song, so don't go thinking it. That's definitely hatred on my behalf). She was arguably one of the best things about the fifth season—if you call it series you don't understand the term series—mortalising the perpetual god-complex of The Oncoming Storm and reminding us that we don't always have to fall in love with the main character of a television show.

Alas, though, that bliss was lost just as soon as it came about. I can't say whether it was in the fact that all the laws of physics (and Timelords) were broken in under 10 seconds, or whether it was the thousand years of aging undone in what was probably a shorter amount of time. We should appreciated the sequential decomposition of the impossible regeneration though, in that it most likely is a subconscious representation of the show in Moffat's hands (although I was going to say 'your', but I figure I'm likely to reach more people on the Internet).

The casually half-eaten bowl of fish-fingers and custard, the clothes strewn about the floor of the TARDIS control room, and arguably the gorgeous paperwork of the fantasy of The Doctor's memory of The Girl Who Waited presented us with a mental conundrum so ridiculous I find it hard to fathom how people still like him (again with the whole reaching people on the Internet thing).
